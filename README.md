Artifacts-ByCreator-Lookback
=========================

## Overview
This new version of [Stories by Creator](https://help.rallydev.com/stories-creator) from the [Rally App Catalog](https://github.com/RallyApps/app-catalog) uses the Lookback API to query for the "Snapshot 0" of an Artifact, and find the Artifact's creator from the first snapshot. This is faster than the old way of parsing the Revision History of the Artifact to find the information.
